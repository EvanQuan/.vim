Issues
=====
- Jedi-vim does not work on PC (from the installation instructions alone) even if Python is already installed???
- Powerline does not necessarily work over SSH. Need to have powerline fonts installed on device being used.
- Powerline separator symbols don't line up correctly on Mac???
    - Various powerline fonts either have the symbol too small, or the symbol is shifted upwards.
    - If using iTerm, changing the font for non-ASCII characters somehwat alleviates this.
- javacomplete2 is not autocompleting. Something to do with compiling javavi?
